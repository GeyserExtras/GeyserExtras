The cape workaround works by using fake mannequin entities 
with player profiles that have a cape on, 
hiding the players body texture using skin patches,
and copying the players movement packets to the fake mannequin entity.
The following player profiles were used to get each cape working.

(so if you are one of the below players, 
it would be really nice if you dont change / take off your cape)

(but do what you want lol :D)
